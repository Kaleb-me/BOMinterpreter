Read the Book of Mormon right from your shell!!

This is a personal project that I put together with what I learned from my CS 111 class. Even though there's plenty of ways to read the Book of Mormon, both online and printed, this project is meant to be a simple, straightforward way to look up and read a single verse or a short section of the Book of Mormon.

User input must be in the format of <Book> <Chapter>:<Verse(optional)>-<Last verse(optional)>

EXAMPLES
- 1 Nephi 3 (prints entire chapter)
- 1 Nephi 3:7 (prints a single verse)
- 1 Nephi 3:7-9 (prints multiple verses)

Things I might change/add
* Code Efficiency: As I learn more, I hope to recognize and revise inefficiencies in the program
* Extended Library: Include the Bible
* Bookmark Feature: Add a bookmark for extensive reading
* Verse of the Day: instead of searching for a specific scripture, the program outputs a random verse.
